In this project, I created a pair of classes that store a series of values. The classes are named miniqueue and ministack. The data type of the values is flexible, and uses a template. The classes can store up to 10 values in an array. They also allow the user to add and remove values from the list, depending on one of the following two methods:

A Queue uses a First In First Out (FIFO) method for storing data. Values are stored in the order they are entered, like a pipeline. The first value into the list is the first to be removed.

A Stack uses a Last In First Out (LIFO) method for storing data. Values are stored in the order they are entered, like a stack of boxes. The first value is on the bottom of the stack, and is the last to be removed.

The project includes testing for underflow and overflow with appropriate error messages. It also demonstrates that the template works with each of the following data types:
•	Integer
•	String

The Main.cpp file was given by the instructor. The rest was implemented by me.

This project was for my introduction to programming II class at university. Using my knowledge from class, I implemented the necessary algorithms/code. I also used my course materials (lecture slides and textbooks) and advice from the professor.
